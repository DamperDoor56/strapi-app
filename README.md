Simply click this [link](strapi-data.up.railway.app) and there you go! You successfully entered to strapi :D You're very smart!

## With cloning

Let's start with cloning this repository 

### Prerequisites
 For the strapi version I used to build this project, you need to have this versions:

| Strapi | Node | npm|
| ------ | ------ |  ------|
|     v4.0.8   |     v16.x.x   |  v6.x.x|

If you use yarn, every version is good!

### Cloning
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. Above the list of files, click Code.

Copy the URL for the repository, open Git Bash. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

```
$cd desktop

```
Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/LudmiDev/cms.git

```
Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/LudmiDev/cms.git
> Cloning into `desktop`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
Then, put npm install, to install all the dependencies

```
npm install 
# or 
yarn add 
```
Then, put npm run develop to watch the project in your localhost

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```
Yay :tada: you're now in strapi locally!
